## Why

I was fed up of not finding a tool to my liking to manage CTFs for teams playing so I wrote one. You should probably not use it ðŸ˜‹ I wrote it quickly because I really couldn't find something that fitted my needs. Some other projects of the sort of collaboration during CTFs:

 - [CTFPad](https://github.com/StratumAuhuur/CTFPad): nice project but NodeJS, so yeah. Also  [`etherpad-lite`](https://yopad.eu) doesn't support MarkDown easily. I like the name, so I took it shamelessly
 - [rizzoma](http://rizzoma.com/): a horrible outdated collaborative platform, poorly suited for CTFs.

I discovered [CodiMD](https://demo.codimd.org), an awesome platform, 100% Markdown, easily integrable. This project is just an eye-candy around using CodiMD as a central platform when doing a challenge collaboratively.

It's a toy project, so there's a lot of TODOs, features will be added (slowly).
